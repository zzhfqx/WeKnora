        This method reconstructs the original text from chunks that may contain:
        - Overlapping content between consecutive chunks
        - Prepended headers that were added during merging (headers have start==end position)

        The algorithm:
        1. Sort chunks by their start position (and end position as tiebreaker)
        2. Track the maximum end position seen so far
        3. For each chunk, extract only the new content (after max_end_pos)
        4. Concatenate all new content pieces

        Args:
            chunks: List of tuples (start_pos, end_pos, chunk_text) from split_text()

        Returns:
            The restored original text

        Example:
            >>> splitter = TextSplitter(chunk_size=10, chunk_overlap=3)
            >>> chunks = splitter.split_text("Hello World!")
            >>> restored = splitter.restore_text(chunks)
            >>> assert restored == "Hello World!"
