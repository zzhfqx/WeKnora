# Base image pinned by digest for reproducibility. Do NOT switch back to the
# floating `nginx:stable-alpine` tag: it drifts with every stable release and a
# newer Alpine base (3.24+) fails to start on old hosts such as CentOS 7
# (kernel 3.10 + old libseccomp), which broke v0.7.0. This digest is
# nginx 1.30.3 / Alpine 3.23.5, the same base as the working v0.6.3 image.
