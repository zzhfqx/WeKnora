-- Description: Environment variables for skill execution. Two things live here:
-- the per-skill declaration an installer agent produces (with the optional
-- workspace-wide value an admin supplies), and the values individual members
-- keep for themselves.
--
-- A member value with an empty skill_id belongs to the whole sandbox config and
-- is injected into every execution on it; one with a skill_id is that skill's
-- declared credential, injected only when a tool names the skill. The storage is
-- shared because it is the same kind of thing — only the load timing differs.
