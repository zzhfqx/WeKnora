-- Migration: 000045_org_tenant_members
--
-- Plan 3 of issue #1303: lift "organization membership" from per-user to
-- per-tenant. Today `organization_members` is keyed on (org_id, user_id) —
-- if Alice (tenant T) joins Org X, her tenant-mate Bob has no visibility
-- into anything shared into Org X. That breaks the company-level
-- collaboration mental model ("our company is in this org") and creates
-- inconsistency with `tenant_disabled_shared_agents`, which is already
-- tenant-scoped.
--
-- The new table `organization_tenant_members` is keyed on (org_id,
-- tenant_id). One row says "tenant T participates in Org O at role R,
-- represented by user U". `representative_user_id` is purely for UI/audit
-- ("who from this tenant brought us here"); permission checks use only
-- (org_id, tenant_id, role).
--
-- Backfill policy: collapse all `organization_members` rows for the same
-- (org, tenant) into a single new row. Role = the highest role observed
-- across the group (admin > editor > viewer). representative_user_id =
-- the earliest joiner. `RAISE NOTICE` flags any (org, tenant) that had
-- conflicting roles so operators can audit the resolved choice.
--
-- The old `organization_members` table is RENAMEd to
-- `organization_members_pre_plan3` so a `down.sql` rollback can restore
-- it. A future destructive migration (gated on
-- `weknora.allow_destructive_migration`) will DROP it once the new model
-- is settled.
