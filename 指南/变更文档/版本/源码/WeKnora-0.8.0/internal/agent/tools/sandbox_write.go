// Package tools — write_sandbox_file.
//
// Lets the LLM write a text file into the current session's sandbox without
// stuffing the bytes through a shell_exec heredoc. shell_exec keeps an 8 KiB
// command cap; generated scripts (PPT builders, reports) routinely exceed it.
//
// Design notes:
//   - Session-scoped: the sandbox is resolved from ToolExecContext.SessionID.
//   - Path guardrail: writes sit under /workspace and never under
//     /workspace/input (staged attachments stay read-only). Prefer
//     /workspace/output for files the user should download.
//   - Content stays out of ToolResult.Data/Output: the model already has the
//     bytes it just sent. The result is path + size so the next call can
//     shell_exec the file.

## Usage
- This is the way to create or overwrite a script, report, or other text
  file. Do NOT dump large files through ` + "`shell_exec`" + ` with ` + "`cat`" + `,
  heredocs, or ` + "`python -c`" + ` — those hit a small command-length cap.
- After writing a script that needs a skill's packages, run it with
  ` + "`execute_skill_script(skill_name=..., script_path=<this path>)`" + `
  so the skill's virtualenv is used. Independent scripts: ` + "`shell_exec`" + `,
  e.g. ` + "`python3 /workspace/output/generate_ppt.py`" + `.
- Put user-facing artifacts (pptx, pdf, png, html) under
  ` + "`/workspace/output`" + ` so they can be collected for download. Scratch
  scripts may live anywhere under ` + "`/workspace`" + ` except
  ` + "`/workspace/input`" + `.
- JSON arguments MUST include both ` + "`path`" + ` and ` + "`content`" + `.
  Emit ` + "`path`" + ` first.
- ` + pythonQuoteGuidance + `

## Large Files: Write In Chunks
One call carries the whole file body inside its JSON arguments, so a big file
does not fit in a single response — the output gets cut off mid-string and the
call is refused. Build it up instead:

1. First chunk: default mode (` + "`mode` omitted or `overwrite`" + `).
2. Every later chunk: ` + "`mode: \"append\"`" + `, same ` + "`path`" + `.

Keep each chunk to a few hundred lines. Split at a structural boundary (a
closing tag, the end of a function) so the file is never left mid-token.
Do NOT resend the earlier chunks — append adds to what is already on disk.
The result reports the running total so you can tell how much has landed.

## When to Use
- Generating a Python/JS/HTML file the sandbox will execute next.
- Saving a long report or config that does not fit in a shell command.
- Overwriting a file you previously wrote in this session.
- Continuing a file you are writing in chunks (` + "`mode: \"append\"`" + `).

## When NOT to Use
- To change a few lines of a file you already wrote, call
  ` + "`edit_sandbox_file`" + ` instead of sending the whole file again.
- To recover from a truncated write: append the missing tail, or fix the
  break with ` + "`edit_sandbox_file`" + `. Rewriting the whole file from the
  top will truncate again at the same place.
- Do not write under ` + "`/workspace/input`" + `: that tree is reserved for
  user-uploaded attachments and is read-only.
- Do not write binary bytes. Have a script produce binary artifacts under
  ` + "`/workspace/output`" + `.

## Path Rules
- ` + "`path`" + ` MUST be an absolute path under ` + "`/workspace`" + `.
- ` + "`/workspace`" + `, ` + "`/workspace/output`" + `, and ` + "`/workspace/input`" + `
  themselves are directories and cannot be used as the file path.

## Size Handling
- %s

## Returns
- The absolute path and the file's total byte count (for an append, also how
  many bytes this call added). File contents are not echoed back.`
