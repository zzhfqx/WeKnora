// Package tools — shell_exec.
//
// General shell command execution primitive for the agent. The LLM can freely
// explore and operate inside its session-scoped Cube MicroVM: inspect files,
// transform data, run programs, install dependencies, and prepare or verify
// skill outputs.
//
// Design notes:
//
//   - Session-sandbox capability: registration is feature-gated on the
//     sandbox backend exposing SandboxCommandExecutor (Cube, E2B, Docker).
//     shell_exec never runs on the WeKnora host.
//   - Session-scoped: the sandbox is resolved from ToolExecContext.SessionID
//     so the LLM cannot execute against a foreign session, and installed
//     dependencies persist across subsequent tool calls in the same session.
//   - Non-zero exit is a normal signal, not an error: pip install failures,
//     missing binaries, etc. are all valid results the LLM must inspect.
//     Only wire-level errors (sandbox unreachable, timeout) surface as
//     ToolResult.Success = false.
//   - Output truncation: shell installers produce thousands of lines that
//     would blow up the LLM context. We keep the head (leading messages)
//     and the tail (final errors) with an ellipsis marker so the tail —
//     usually the most informative segment — is preserved.
//   - Command shape blacklist: the sandbox is throwaway, but we still refuse
//     obviously destructive patterns (rm -rf /, fork bombs, mkfs...) to
//     protect the LLM from its own hallucinations.
//   - No backgrounding, no stdin: matches the confirmed product decisions.
//     Trailing '&' and 'nohup' are rejected up-front to avoid orphaned
//     processes inside the sandbox.

var shellExecTool = BaseTool{
	name: ToolShellExec,
	description: `Run a shell command inside the current session's isolated remote sandbox.

## Working Directory
- Every command already starts in ` + "`/workspace`" + `, this session's own
  workspace. Use RELATIVE paths (` + "`ls -la output/`" + `,
  ` + "`python3 report.py`" + `) and do NOT prefix ` + "`cd /workspace && `" + `
  onto them — you are already there, and the prefix wastes a line on every call.
- ` + "`input/`" + ` holds the user's uploaded files and is read-only;
  ` + "`output/`" + ` is collected for download, so generated files belong there.
- Each call starts in that directory again: a ` + "`cd`" + ` inside one command
  does not carry over to the next one. Pass ` + "`work_dir`" + ` when a command
  must run elsewhere.

## Usage
- Use freely to explore and operate inside the sandbox: inspect files, search
  content, transform data, run programs, manage dependencies, install system packages and verify outputs.
- Prefer tools that already ship: ` + "`find`" + ` / ` + "`ls`" + ` to discover files;
  ` + "`cat`" + ` / ` + "`head`" + ` / ` + "`tail`" + ` / ` + "`sed`" + ` to inspect text;
  ` + "`grep`" + ` / ` + "`awk`" + ` to search; ` + "`file`" + ` for an unknown type.
  Do not ` + "`apt-get install`" + ` inspection utilities (` + "`tree`" + `, editors)
  after a 127 — those packages vanish with the session.
- User-uploaded files are listed in the current ` + "`<sandbox_attachments>`" + `
  block, with the absolute ` + "`/workspace/input/...`" + ` path to pass to a
  command that takes an input file.
- Install extra Python packages into the session overlay
  (` + "`python3 -m pip install --target /workspace/.skill-packages/<skill> ...`" + `),
  never into ` + "`/opt/weknora/tenant/skills`" + `. The skill venv is frozen after
  install. ` + "`apt-get`" + ` is only for a system library this task actually needs,
  not to recover from probing with a missing inspection command.
- The sandbox is one long-lived session: files written and packages installed by
  an earlier call are still there for later ` + "`shell_exec`" + ` and
  ` + "`execute_skill_script`" + ` calls. Do not redo setup you already did.

## When to Use
- Whenever executing a command is the most direct way to complete the task.
- To inspect any text file or directory in the sandbox, including system paths.
- To chain shell pipelines, unpack archives, compile or run code, and prepare
  intermediate files for later commands or skills.

## When NOT to Use
- DO NOT run ANY script that needs a skill's packages (` + "`docx`" + `,
  ` + "`pptx`" + `, pandas, …) from here — generating a file counts, not just
  inspecting one. System ` + "`python3`" + ` has none of them. Write the script with
  ` + "`write_sandbox_file`" + ` and run it with
  ` + "`execute_skill_script(skill_name=..., script_path=/workspace/output/... )`" + `,
  which uses the skill's own interpreter and sets ` + "`PYTHONPATH`" + ` / ` + "`NODE_PATH`" + `
  for you. Do NOT wire that environment by hand
  (` + "`PYTHONPATH=... python3 script.py`" + `, or calling ` + "`.venv/bin/python`" + `
  directly): the skill's interpreter already carries what was installed with it,
  so the hand-wired version just makes you reinstall it. Also do not judge a
  skill's dependencies with a bare ` + "`python3 -c`" + ` / ` + "`node -e`" + `.
  ` + "`read_skill`" + ` names the skill and how to reach its environment.
- DO NOT ` + "`chown`" + ` / ` + "`chmod`" + ` / ` + "`ensurepip`" + ` / ` + "`pip install`" + ` a skill
  under ` + "`/opt/weknora/tenant/skills`" + `. That tree is read-only after install
  and ` + "`uv venv`" + ` often has no pip. On-demand extras go to
  ` + "`python3 -m pip install --target /workspace/.skill-packages/<skill> <package>`" + `
  (system python3), then ` + "`execute_skill_script`" + `. Or ask the user to
  reinstall the skill so extras are baked in.
- DO NOT try to background processes (` + "`&`" + ` at the end, ` + "`nohup`" + `). Sandbox
  execution is synchronous.
- DO NOT write large files with ` + "`cat`" + `, heredocs, or ` + "`python -c`" + `. Use
  ` + "`write_sandbox_file`" + ` for the file, then run it from here. To change a
  few lines of an existing file, use ` + "`edit_sandbox_file`" + ` instead of
  rewriting it.
- DO NOT ` + "`ls`" + ` / ` + "`find`" + ` / ` + "`cat`" + ` / ` + "`file`" + ` a skill under
  ` + "`/opt/weknora/tenant/skills`" + ` to discover or read its scripts.
  ` + "`read_skill(skill_name)`" + ` already lists them; that tree also contains
  ` + "`.venv`" + ` / ` + "`node_modules`" + `. A ` + "`.cjs`" + ` / ` + "`.js`" + ` / ` + "`.py`" + `
  path is already a script — call ` + "`execute_skill_script`" + `.

## Parameters
- ` + "`command`" + ` (required): the shell one-liner to run under ` + "`/bin/bash -l -c`" + `.
  Supports pipes, redirects, ` + "`&&`" + ` / ` + "`||`" + ` chaining. Keep this short;
  large scripts go through ` + "`write_sandbox_file`" + `; small edits go through
  ` + "`edit_sandbox_file`" + `. Watch the quoting: never nest an ASCII
  ` + "`\"`" + ` inside ` + "`\"...\"`" + ` (or ` + "`'`" + ` inside ` + "`'...'`" + `) —
  use the other quote, and 「」 for Chinese quotation marks.
- ` + "`work_dir`" + ` (optional): an absolute path under ` + "`/workspace`" + `,
  defaulting to ` + "`/workspace`" + ` itself — omit it unless the command has to
  run in another directory. Created on demand if it doesn't exist.
- ` + "`timeout_sec`" + ` (optional): per-call timeout in seconds. Defaults to 120,
  capped at 600. Large installs (LibreOffice, TensorFlow) may need the cap.
- ` + "`max_output_bytes`" + ` (optional): maximum bytes returned from stdout.
  Defaults to 16384, capped at 65536. Stderr is independently limited to 8192
  bytes by default; ` + "`max_stderr_bytes`" + ` may raise it to at most 16384.
  The complete visible result is always capped at 65536 bytes.
- ` + "`env`" + ` (optional): extra environment variables merged on top of the
  sandbox's base env, e.g. ` + "`{\"PIP_INDEX_URL\": \"https://mirrors.tencent.com/pypi/simple\"}`" + `.
- ` + "`skill_name`" + ` (optional): name of a skill whose environment variables should
  be injected into this command's process only. Use when running a skill's
  command by hand that needs its credentials; values are scoped to the current
  caller and do not persist. Omit for ordinary commands.

## Returns
- ` + "`exit_code`" + `: 0 on success, non-zero on failure. Non-zero is NOT a tool
  error — the tool call succeeds; you should read stderr and decide what to
  do next (retry, adjust arguments, tell the user).
- ` + "`stdout`" + ` / ` + "`stderr`" + `: captured output, truncated to preserve context
  budget. The tail is preserved when truncation happens, since the final
  lines usually carry the crucial error message.
- Binary output is never returned to the model. Store binary files under
  ` + "`/workspace/output`" + ` so ArtifactCollector can expose them for download.
- To show one of those files in your answer, reference it as
  ` + "`![description](sandbox:<file name>)`" + ` with the exact file name and no
  directory path. Images render inline; charts, tables, and documents render as
  a card the user clicks to preview. A bare file name or a
  ` + "`/workspace/output/...`" + ` path does not resolve in the browser.
- ` + "`duration_ms`" + `: wall-clock execution time.

## Safety
- The command runs inside a session-scoped MicroVM: destructive commands
  only affect this session's sandbox, never the host or other sessions.
- Obviously destructive patterns (` + "`rm -rf /`" + `, fork bombs, ` + "`mkfs`" + `, ` + "`shutdown`" + `)
  are refused up-front. Cleaning up your own scratch dir (e.g.
  ` + "`rm -rf /workspace/tmp`" + `) is fine.
- Only available when the session sandbox advertises a command executor
  (Cube, E2B, Docker). The command never runs on the WeKnora host.`,

## Working Directory
- Every command already starts in ` + "`" + defaultWorkDir + "`" + `, the skill
  you are installing. Use RELATIVE paths: ` + "`ls -la scripts/`" + `,
  ` + "`cat requirements.txt`" + `, ` + "`uv venv --seed .venv`" + `.
- Do NOT prefix ` + "`cd " + defaultWorkDir + " && `" + ` onto your commands.
  You are already there, and the prefix wastes a line on every call.
- Pass ` + "`work_dir`" + ` only to leave that directory, which an install
  rarely needs.

## Usage
- Run commands with this tool. Create or change files in the skill directory
  with ` + "`write_skill_file`" + ` / ` + "`edit_skill_file`" + ` instead of
  ` + "`cat`" + ` or a heredoc: a shell redirect truncates at the
  command-length cap and mangles quoting.
- Install Python extras into the skill's ` + "`.venv`" + `, Node extras into
  ` + "`node_modules`" + `. Prefer ` + "`uv pip install`" + ` / ` + "`python3 -m venv`" + `.

## Parameters
- ` + "`command`" + ` (required): the shell one-liner under ` + "`/bin/bash -l -c`" + `.
- ` + "`work_dir`" + ` (optional): defaults to ` + "`" + defaultWorkDir + "`" + `.
- ` + "`timeout_sec`" + ` (optional): defaults to 600 seconds.

## Returns
- ` + "`exit_code`" + `, ` + "`stdout`" + `, ` + "`stderr`" + `. Non-zero is not a
  tool error — read stderr and adapt.`
