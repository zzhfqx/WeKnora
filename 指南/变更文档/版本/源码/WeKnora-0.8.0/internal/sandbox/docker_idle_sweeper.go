// Idle reclamation for the docker backend.
//
// Every other backend gets this for free. Cube and E2B are told an idle
// timeout at creation and the provider pauses or kills the sandbox when it
// elapses, which is why SessionBoundManager never reaps anything itself. The
// Docker daemon has no such concept: a container runs until something stops
// it. Without a sweep, one abandoned session pins its memory and CPU share on
// the host forever.
//
// The sweep needs to know when a sandbox was last used, and Docker exposes no
// exec timestamps. Labels cannot help either — they are immutable after
// create. So each exec touches an activity marker file inside the container
// (folded into the exec wrapper, costing no extra round-trip), and the sweep
// reads its mtime with a single HEAD /archive call per container.
//
// Deleting an idle container needs no coordination with the binding store: the
// lifecycle already treats a sandbox the provider no longer has as replaceable
// (see CanReplaceRemoteBinding), which is exactly how an E2B sandbox reaped by
// its own TTL is handled.
