// Package sandbox: what makes an existing sandbox operable.
//
// Two groups of configuration fields decide whether the sandboxes a config has
// already created can still be acted on. This file names them in one place
// because the answer depends on which SDK carries which value:
//
//   - Control plane (API URL, API key): every lifecycle call - list, delete,
//     pause, resume, refresh timeout - is issued against it. Lose it and the
//     sandboxes can no longer be reclaimed at all.
//   - Data plane (sandbox domain, and for Cube the proxy endpoint): envd traffic
//     is routed through it. Lose it and the sandboxes are still deletable but no
//     longer usable, so every live session on the config fails at once.
//
// The split is a property of the clients in use, not a universal truth:
// github.com/matiasinsaurralde/go-e2b resolves the API base URL and the sandbox
// domain independently, whereas E2B's own JS/Python SDKs derive the API base from
// the domain (https://api.${domain}). Swapping that dependency would move the
// domain into the control-plane group.

// Because named configs inherit nothing, the stored row is the whole picture and
// no deployment baseline is consulted. Unknown type strings are compared verbatim
// rather than rejected: a typo yields an identity that matches nothing, which
// errs toward refusing the edit, and ParseSandboxType reports it on save.
//
// This runs no SSRF guard and returns no error on purpose. It answers "would this
// edit strand anything", a question that must stay answerable when the OLD
// endpoint no longer resolves — precisely the situation in which an admin needs
// to re-point the config. Validating the incoming URLs is the save path's job.
