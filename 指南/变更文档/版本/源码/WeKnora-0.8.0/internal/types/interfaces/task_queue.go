// TaskPendingOpsRepository persists rows for the generic task pending
// queue (`task_pending_ops`). The queue is the durable replacement for
// the Redis-list-backed wiki:pending:<kbID> queue. It is intentionally
// stateless about consumer semantics: the (TaskType, Scope, ScopeID)
// tuple is the only routing primitive the repository understands;
// deduplication, batching, and retry policy live in the consumer.
//
// Concurrency model: two consumption primitives coexist.
//   - PeekBatch does NOT take row locks; consumers enforce per-(scope_id)
//     serialization out-of-band (e.g. an external Redis lock). This is the
//     original primitive and is still used by single-process (Lite) mode.
//   - ClaimBatch DOES take row locks (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED on
//     Postgres) and marks rows with claimed_at, so multiple concurrent
//     consumers of the same tuple pull DISJOINT rows without an external
//     lock. This is what lets the wiki pipeline drop its exclusive per-KB
//     batch lock and spread one KB's backlog across the whole worker pool.

	// A row is eligible when it is unclaimed (claimed_at IS NULL) or its
	// claim is stale (claimed_at < staleBefore) — the latter recovers rows
	// abandoned by a crashed worker. On Postgres the per-key anchor row is
	// locked with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED so concurrent claimers take
	// disjoint key sets without blocking or double-claiming.
