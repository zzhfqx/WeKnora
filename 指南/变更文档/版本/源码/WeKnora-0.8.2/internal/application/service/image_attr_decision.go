// DecideOCR is a pure function: no ctx, no repo, no model. Input the observed
// attributes and the policy; output whether OCR runs. It is the single place
// the "need OCR" decision lives, so it can be unit-tested and replayed.
//
// The default policy encodes, for every attribute the table reads:
//
//	ocr = (contain.text == "block")
//	    || (contain.data_visual == true)
//	    || the attribute was not observed (conservative: OnUnobserved)
//
// where "not observed" covers both a line the model never wrote and a value that
// was not one of the allowed ones — the parser leaves such an attribute absent
// rather than inventing a default. An incomplete observation therefore keeps
// extracting, so a missed block of text costs one extra call instead of being
// lost.
//
// The result is equivalent to the old 7-class table: decorative / logo / photo
// (text reliably absent or captured by the description) skip OCR;
// text_screenshot / table / chart / other run OCR.
