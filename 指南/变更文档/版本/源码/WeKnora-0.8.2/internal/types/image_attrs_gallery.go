// The system attribute registry doubles as a gallery attribute source: every
// attribute declared for the observe-and-describe pipeline is offered to the
// image gallery, defaulting to filterable (the observation values are small
// ordered sets, which is what the gallery's extent / presence filters render
// best). The gallery's config tiers can override these flags at runtime —
// this registration is only the lowest-priority fallback.
//
// This file depends on the gallery's neutral source hook
// (types/gallery_attr_source.go). Merge the gallery PR first, or land the
// hook file together with this commit — both PRs carry byte-identical copies
// of that file so either merge order resolves cleanly.
