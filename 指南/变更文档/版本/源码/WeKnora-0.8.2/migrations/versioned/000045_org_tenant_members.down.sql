-- Reverse migration for 000045_org_tenant_members.

-- Restore organization_members from the parked _pre_plan3 table and drop
-- the new tenant-scoped table. Because we only RENAMEd the original on
-- the way up, no data is lost on rollback — the legacy rows are still
-- intact under the renamed table.
--
-- If the parked table no longer exists (e.g. a later destructive
-- migration already dropped it), this script falls through gracefully:
-- the IF EXISTS guards leave the database in whatever state it was in.
